"""

Defines the mathematical part of an IVP (initial value problem)
specified in the general form:

`F(t, y) =  G(t, y, dy)` with `y(t0)= y0`

Depending on the combination of the parameters this type can represent
a wide range of problems, including ODE, DAE and IMEX.  Nevertheless
not all solvers will support any combinations of `F` and `G`.  Note
that not specifying `G` amounts to `G=dy/dt`.


- `tspan` -- tuple `(start_t,end_t)`
- `y0` -- initial condition
- `F!` -- in-place `F` function `F!(t,y,res)`.  If `F=0` set to `nothing`.
- `G!` -- in-place `G` function `G!(t,y,dy,res)`.  If `G=dy/dt` then
          set to `nothing` (or `dy` if the solver supports this).  Can
          also be a mass matrix for a RHS `M dy/dt`
- `J!` -- in-place Jacobian function `J!(t,y,dy,res)`.

TODO: how to fit the sparsity pattern in J?
